Conscious Swtich (cwitch, pronounced switch)
is a cross platform system tray app that allows you
create some modes via a json file(`data.json`) and
tracks the time you spend between these modes.

Great way to switch between tasks, modes etc consciously and mindfully.

It's aim is to help you reduce unconscious and mindless activities(browser tab switches, social media, youtube etc)
